			<h1>Encouragement</h1>
			<p>Don't allow others make the decision for you." What if your friend's cynicism is the reason they will not vote?  Reframe their perspective by reminding them that abstaining means giving up their rights and liberties to those who vote.  How is that preferable to "proving a point" by abstaining?  "Decisions that are going to affect your life, your family's life, and the direction of the country are going to get made either way, whether you participate or not," Favreau explains. As citizens, we have the power to shape our future with each vote we cast. Voting isn't just a right—it’s a responsibility to ourselves, our communities, and the generations to come. Take the time to educate yourself, think critically, and choose the leaders and policies that reflect your values and vision for a better tomorrow. Every vote counts, and together, we can make a meaningful difference. Let’s vote wisely and create the change we want to see!</p>
